## Elevator Pitch

One way that Harvard University has fostered inclusivity and belonging on campus is by increasing access to gender-neutral restrooms and lacation facility across campus. But employees or students of one school may not know where to find these resources as they travel to different buildings across campus. My app will provide a unified map of these locations to help increase their visibility at the University.

## Goals

### Organizational

At the University level, the goal is to create a sense of inclusivity and belonging by providing private facilities to, separately, accomodate the needs of gender-nonconfirming members of the community and nursing mothers.

### User

Users of the app need to know where they can find the types of facilities they need anywhere on campus.

### App

The app's goal is to display the gender-neutral bathroom or lactation room that is closest to the user-specified location.

### Learning

For my own purposes, I hope to learn more about building a progressive web app (PWA) or native mobile app with web technologies (React Native). I also want to experiment more with geographic information systems (GIS) and general data visualization techniques to find interesting ways of presenting information. 

## Metrics

The primary metric of the app will be awareness of these facilities across the university. I am working on this as a pilot within the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS), which recently undertook a Climate Survey to determine how members of the community feel about their own belonging on campus. Any chance in awareness correlated with the app could be measured by conducting a similar follow-up survey after the app is released.

Given the somewhat private nature of the app, I'm hesitant to collect detailed statistics about when, where, and how the app is used--I certainly wouldn't want any user to feel that they were being followed into the bathroom. However, I do plan to collect anonymized statistics about how often the app is used to help get a general sense of it's rate of adoption.
