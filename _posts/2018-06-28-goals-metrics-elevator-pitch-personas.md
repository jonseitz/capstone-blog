## Elevator Pitch

Everyone at Harvard should feel welcome within the University's walls. It's not just a premiere academic institution, but also one of the state's largest employers. But even as Harvard has tried to make its students, faculty, and employees feel like they belong by, among other things, adding gender-neutral restrooms and lactation rooms around campus, sometimes Harvard itself can get in the way--crazy acronyms, multiple campuses, and different numbering schemes in every building. My app, "Inclusive Harvard", will try to cut back at least a little of that obscurity by providing simple, sensible direction to the gender-neutral restrooms or lactation rooms closest to the user.

## Goals

### Organizational

At the University level, the goal is to create a sense of inclusivity and belonging by providing private facilities to, separately, accommodate the needs of gender-nonconforming members of the community and nursing mothers.

### User

Users want to feel comfortable anywhere on campus and go about their jobs, research, and studies, just like anyone else.

### App

The app's goal is to display the gender-neutral bathroom or lactation room that is closest to the user-specified location.

### Learning

For my own purposes, I hope to learn more about building a progressive web app (PWA) or native mobile app with web technologies (React Native). I also want to experiment more with geographic information systems (GIS) and general data visualization techniques to find interesting ways of presenting information.

## Metrics

The primary metric of the app will be awareness of these facilities across the university. I am working on this as a pilot within the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS), which recently undertook a Climate Survey to determine how members of the community feel about their own belonging on campus. Any chance in awareness correlated with the app could be measured by conducting a similar follow-up survey after the app is released.

Given the somewhat private nature of the app, I'm hesitant to collect detailed statistics about when, where, and how the app is used--I certainly wouldn't want any user to feel that they were being followed into the bathroom. However, I do plan to collect anonymous statistics about how often the app is used to help get a general sense of it's rate of adoption.

## Personas

### 1. Alex

![Alex]({{ '/assets/alex.jpg' | absolute_url }})

_"Back in Sweden, my friends and I always made jokes about Americans and their obsession with bathrooms... Now that's always in my mind whenever I'm looking for one here."_

**Profile:** Extension student on campus for the summer

**Gender**: nonconforming

**Age**: 23

**Current Location:** Harvard Square

**Hometown:** Gothenburg, Sweden

**Occupation:** Grad Student

**Motivations:** Alex is working on an ALM program through the extension school and will be fulfilling the on-campus requirement during the summer. Alex doesn't believe that gender should be treated as binary, and doesn't identify as male or female. Back at home in Sweden, Alex knows all the best places to find single-person and gender-neutral bathrooms. But all the news stories about debates in America over who is allowed to use which bathrooms have made Alex a little uneasy and concerned about what to do at Harvard.

**Goals:**

- Wants to enjoy Harvard and get the full campus experience
- Holds a strong conviction that gender is a societal construct and wants to live their own life.

**Frustrations:**

- News stories about "Bathroom Bills" and hate crimes in America make it seems like asking the wrong person can end badly.
- Even liberal Cambridge is more conservative than Sweden, and Alex doesn't want to be ostracized by classmates.

### 2. Beverly

![Beverly]({{ '/assets/beverly.jpg' | absolute_url }})

_"Even with no sleep I can deal with professors making outrageous last minute requests for extra funding, but trying to track down a lactation room M-112B in a building I've never seen before may be my breaking point."_

**Profile:** New mother

**Gender:** female

**Age:** 32

**Current Location:** Living in Framingham, Mass., working at Harvard

**Occupation:** Research Portfolio Manager at SEAS

**Motivations:** Beverly recently came back to work after the birth of her first child. She shares with two other admins, but fortunately there's a lactation room nearby office so she has regular access to a private space when she needs to pump. However, her job often requires her to a number of different labs and offices across different schools at the University, including across the river at the innovation lab and the Med School. Some days, Beverly never even makes it back to her own office. She doesn't want to let motherhood hold her back from doing her job, but also worries about getting stranded on the other side of campus and not knowing where to go when its time to pump.

**Goals:**

- Beverly prides herself on meeting all the needs of the faculty members that she assists.
- She's thinks that she's excellent at her job, and hopes to one day get promoted to Area Director.
- This is her first child, but she and her husband are hoping to continue growing their family.

**Frustrations:**

- An unexpected trip to the Medical School can send her away from campus for half the day or more.
- Even though she's read through the list of lactation rooms on the HR website, many of the old buildings at Harvard have unintuitive floor- and room-numbering schemes, making it harder to find the room she needs.
- Registering to use a lactation room requires her to submit a registration form in advance.
