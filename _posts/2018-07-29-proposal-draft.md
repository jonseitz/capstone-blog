title: Initial Proposal Draft

Here is the [initial draft][draft] of my project proposal.

I haven't made too many changes from what I've described in the blog posts along the way. One recent development is that I now have CAD files for the floorplans of the buildings that are going to be included, and I've been going back and forth with the planning office about how to make them acceptable for public consumption. Harvard Information Security rules don't allow you to make detailed floorplans available, so I'll need to edit the files before they can be used in the app. I haven't done much work in CAD before, so I'll need to learn my way around [LibreCAD][lcad] or another CAD editing program. Does anyone have suggestions for resources on that?

One thing I've been debating is how much prototyping I should do of the User Interface early in the project. I could make some low-fidelity mockups with static HTML, with just client-side React and no database, but that make take more of time that could be better spent elsewhere. Is the trade-off worth it to get better feedback earlier?

I appreciate any feedback and suggestions.
