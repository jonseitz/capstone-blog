title: Competitor Review
---

The primary focus of my app is helping people find facilities and services they need on Harvard's campus. This is not a unique proposition, nor is it particularly unique to help people find restrooms. However, I think that defining and targeting a narrow niche is the best way to succeed in this space.

## Competitor #1: Inclusive U

A web and mobile app mapping gender inclusive restrooms on the campus of the University of Texas at Austin, available online at [http://diversity.utexas.edu/genderandsexuality/gender-inclusive-restrooms/](http://diversity.utexas.edu/genderandsexuality/gender-inclusive-restrooms/)

**Market Share:** The University of Texas has over 50,000 undergraduates, and the city of Austin has around 1 million residents, so the potential market for this app is fairly large. Apple's app store doesn't list download numbers and Google Play no longer seems to carry the app, so it's hard to approximate the number of downloads.

**Tone of Language:** The app is presented by the University's Gender & Sexuality Center, which has an overall tone that is positive and inclusive while taking it's subject matter seriously. It doesn't use playful language while discussing restrooms, and doesn't make any assumptions about its users.

**Key Differences:** Compared to the others, this is the most narrowly focused: Only gender-inclusive restrooms and only on the UT-Austin campus. In this way it is very similar to my app, and in fact was one of its inspirations. I think this narrow focus is a benefit, in that it's very easy to explain the app and its usefulness.

**Target Audience:** The copy on the Gender & Sexuality Center website specifically says that it serves "Women & LGBTA communities," and obviously it is aimed at people on the UT-Austin campus.

**User Response:** UT-Austin was ranked number 16 on a list of the [50 best colleges for LGBTQ Students](https://www.collegechoice.net/rankings/best-lgbt-friendly-colleges-and-universities/) with a specific mention of the work being done by the Gender & Sexuality Center. Harvard did not appear on the list.

**Competitor Goals:** The goals for this app are very closely aligned to those of my own app--making all students and visitors feel welcome on the UT campus by locating gender-neutral restrooms. The user goals are also very similar: wanting to get the typical college experience without needing to worry about things like finding an appropriate restroom.

_Additional Comparison_

**Data Accuracy:** Inclusive U appears to be relying on the University's own data about restroom locations on campus, and invites users to submit additions or corrections to the Gender & Sexuality Center. The website also has notes on many of the restrooms and photos stored on Google Drive. It is unclear how often this data is updated though.

## Competitor #2: Harvard Mobile

Harvard's primary mobile app combines an interactive campus map, person directory, news and events listing, shuttle tracker, and other features that are useful for people on campus. Much of the information is similar to what can be found on the [main university site](https://www.harvard.edu), and the campus map in particular can be found online at [https://map.harvard.edu/](https://map.harvard.edu/)

**Market Share:** The "Harvard Community" comprises about 50,000 people, including faculty, staff and students. The Harvard Mobile app has over 50,000 downloads on Google Play, dating back to around 2013, with similar number likely on the Apple app store, dating back to 2010. Given that the app is heavily promoted on campus, I suspect that more than half of the population on campus has downloaded it at one point or another.

**Tone of Language:** The overall app is very direct and to-the-point. In some of the news and informational sections it can be very booster-ish of the university, and maintains the overall air of academic prestige that the university's communications put forward.

**Key Differences:** This is sort of a "Swiss army knife" app for Harvard. It does a lot of things pretty well, though I suspect most people use it for one or two specific things. However, I know that I personally don't keep it on my phone because the features that I would need from it are better served by the school's website.

**Target Audience:** The app seems to primary target current students, with lists of course offerings, dining hall information, and shuttle bus schedules. There is also an admissions section, so there's likely some push for potential students. It doesn't seem particularly targeted at staff or faculty, which is one audience that I plan to include in my app.

**User Response:** Overall good reviews, with 4.4 stars out of 5 on Google Play (though several of those just say "nice" or "I like Harvard" so take that with a grain of salt). My anecdotal impression is that many people think the Harvard app is fine, but not essential.

**Competitor Goals:** I think that overall, this is a marketing app for Harvard and was originally released during the early smartphone days when it seemed like everyone needed to have an app. That said, the app's goal is to keep people up to date and informed about news and events at Harvard. I think, though, that most users are more interested in one or two things the app offers (like the shuttle schedule) and may not need all of this in one place.

_Additional Comparison_

**Data Accuracy:** This app also relies on official university data, especially around mapping. The online map in particular includes footprints of all the buildings and a number of additional data points. The map layers include features for things like accessibility, public safety, and bike facilities, but it does not include any overlay data about restrooms.

## Competitor #3: Sit or Squat

Sit or Squat is a mobile app from Charmin that shows the locations of public restrooms near the user, with the ability to rank them on cleanliness as either Sit (clean enough to sit on the toilet) or Squat (when its better to not). Information about the app is at [https://www.charmin.com/en-us/about-us/sitorsquat](https://www.charmin.com/en-us/about-us/sitorsquat).

**Market Share:** The app lists over 100,000 downloads on Google Play. Given that its bathroom database covers the US and few other countries, that implies a fairly small market share relative to its potential audience.

**Tone of Language:** As could be surmised from the name, the tone is very playful and jokey. It fits into the tone of Charmin's overall marketing strategy (slogan: "Enjoy the go!") and prominently features the company's cartoon bear mascots. It is also far more subjective overall, as it aims to rank bathrooms, not just locate them.

**Key Differences:** This app covers a significantly larger area than either of the others, and as such it relies on users to contribute reviews and information about bathrooms. It also incorporates Facebook Connect to add a social element (signing in to add reviews and post pictures).

**Target Audience:** The marketing materials don't seem oriented toward any specific audience, but some of the reviews and testimonials specifically mention that it's great for parents with small children.

**User Response:** It has an overall rating of 3.9 stars out of 5 on Google Play, and 4.2 out of 5 on Apple. Many of the recent reviews are more negative, focusing on out-of-date data and issues with the connectivity. A review from Parenting Magazine on the Charmin website says that it is "one of the best apps for simplifying a parent's life."

**Competitor Goals:** Organizationally, this is marketing for Charmin by trying to make the brand synonymous with going to the bathroom and using the social side of the app to keep users connected. On the user side, I think most users are trying to find a bathroom near them, and would like to get a sense ahead of time whether it will be clean or not.

_Additional Comparison_

**Data Accuracy:** This is the only one that explicitly relies on user-contributed data, which may be why many of the recent reviews specifically cite out-of-date and faulty data as problems. It also provides a way to connect with Facebook. I don't think that's a good idea--even without the recent news about Facebook's data collection practices, I personally would want to share information about when and where I use the bathroom, correlated with other personality traits, with a corporation like Charmin.

## Comparison with "Inclusive Harvard"

I think the biggest strength for my app is focus. Rather than try to solve every possible problem faced by every user on campus, the goal is to solve it's particular problems as well as it can. In that way, it's probably closest to the Inclusive U app from Texas. But I intend to provide some additional functionality beyond what that app offers. The web version of Inclusive U, for instance, is only an annotated Google Map. I hope to be able to offer additional detail based on the specific location provided, and to do so with a mobile-friendly product.

That said, the opportunity I would most like to address is one to bring everyone closer into the community. I've been fortunate enough to work at Harvard for almost a decade, and in that time I've absorbed plenty of useful knowledge that I draw on every day. I think that the Charmin app tried to get people to share that kind of information, and they didn't; without a fallback plan, the app has wilted. At the other end of the spectrum, the Harvard app has all kinds of official data, but it doesn't offer a true window in the community.
