## What strengths do I bring?

I have a strong sense of design and skills in front- and back-end development, so I feel confident coming in that I can deliver a functioning application. I'm also coming in with a pretty good knowledge of Harvard, having worked here since 2009. As an employee at SEAS, I also already have access with many of the people who can help me find the data I will need.

## What do I need to learn?

I know that I need to learn more about the people in my target audience, and the issues that affect them. Simply put, I'm a straight white man in my 30s--I haven't personally experienced what it's like to be a transgender student at college, and I don't know what it's like to be afraid about which bathroom I use or to need to find a lactation room on campus in a hurry. I hope that by interviewing potential users and designing the app with empathy, I'll be able to offer a useful product.

## What opportunities will this bring?

I expect that this app will further my career by demonstrating to my bosses, and to the leadership of the school, that I can create an effective application that furthers one of the university's goals. It should also help my future employment prospects by providing an additional portfolio piece, and by fulfilling the requirement for my Master's Degree and thus bolstering my resume.

## What project risks are there?

I can already say my biggest risk is my ability to get accurate data about the locations of bathrooms on campus. I've already done some initial research and it looks like that data does exist in some form, but making sure that it is up to date will definitely be a challenge. As I am doing this through work, there is also the chance that my other responsibilities will increase and take time away from the project, in which case I may need to use some vacation days to buy myself more time.

## What life risks are there?

I have actually been discussing with my boss about taking on some additional responsibilities at work which would like pick up at the beginning and end of the semester--two key points in the project timeline. I have also had issues with stress and anxiety in the past, so I will need to keep myself organized and on-track to avoid getting too burned out before the end of the project.
