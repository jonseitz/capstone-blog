I'm an Application Developer at Harvard's John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, where I focus on user experience and front-end development with a bit of devops on the side. I do almost all of my development work in Javascript, especially React and Node. 

I live in Dedham, MA with my wife and our dog. When I'm not buried in a computer project, I'm usually buried in some kind of DIY woodworking project around the house.
