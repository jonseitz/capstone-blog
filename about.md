My name is Jonathan Seitz, and I'm an Application Developer at Harvard's John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, I focus on user experience and front-end development with a bit of devops on the side. I do almost all of my _work_ work in Javascript, specifically React and Node, and I've done some tinkering with Rust on the side.

Before getting into programming, I studied Journalism at Boston University and worked in magazine production for several years. Taking my first programming courses at the Extension School made me realize that I very much preferred bits and pixels to ink and paper, and I've been carrying on with this path ever since. I'm very interested in Linux and its derivatives in the broader open source software world, and I've gradually moved all of my computers over to Linux-only (XFCE FTW).

I grew up in Fort Myers, Fla. but I've lived in the Boston area since 2005. I currently live in Dedham, Mass. with my wife and our dog. When I'm not buried in a computer project, I enjoy photography, playing the guitar, and doing a variety of DIY woodworking project around the house.
