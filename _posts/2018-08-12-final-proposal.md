Here is the [final draft][final] of my project proposal.

There have been few small corrections since the draft phase. Based on feedback from classmates, I also added a bit more detail about user testing in the Design Workflow section, specifically outlining that I'll start with a small number of co-workers before moving on to testing with actual users and the Harvard Library User Research Center.
